## General Guidelines

1. **Explain your approach first**  
   Before editing or suggesting any file changes, clearly describe the approach you plan to take.  
   Wait for explicit user confirmation before making or suggesting any edits.

2. **Never assume**  
   Do **not** assume any detail that isn’t explicitly provided.  
   If something is unclear — **ask the user first**.

3. **Prioritize clarity and precision**  
   Focus on correctness, clarity, and adherence to the repository’s structure and conventions.  
   Avoid speculative or creative changes.

4. **Keep responses minimal and meaningful**  
   Your output should directly help the user accomplish their goal.  
   Avoid unnecessary explanations or unrelated suggestions.

5. **Maintain context awareness**  
   Always consider:
   - Existing code style and architecture  
   - Repository folder structure  
   - Dependencies and configuration files  

6. **Update `README.md` when required**  
   Whenever a **new feature** is added, a **functionality is modified**, or **usage changes**, you must:
   - Review the existing `README.md`  
   - Update or append relevant sections (e.g., setup, usage, API reference, feature list)  
   - Clearly summarize the change in simple, user-friendly language  

7. **Communicate file impact**  
   When proposing edits, **list all affected files and functions** explicitly before showing the changes.
